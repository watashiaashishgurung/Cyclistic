We can see from the timelines I created on tableau that most bikers like to ride their bikes preferably during the second, the third and final quarter of the year. The subscribers tripduration us fairly consistent durinng the week but tend to ride lesser during the weekends. Whereas our customers ride bikes more fashionably during the weekends.

Most years we reach peak tripdurations of custumors during the weekends of late summer. This is because of the holiday season. And in anticipation of the new acadamical year. The demand for a bike is then the highest due to verious reason.

One of the reasons is the pleasent outside temperatures
Another reason is as the traffic gets busier towards the end of the holidays, people are in need of quick and easy means of transportation
Another factor that may convince our audience is to ride our bike for economical as the most people spent money during the passed holiday season. People may want to save money for acadamic puchases.
Another factor is that as the days get shorter and the darkness of the night may forces us to move quicker, people are more in need to get to places faster
=We can use digital media to promote our services targetting different audience based on their means of transportation, one way to do so is to make various commercials targetting "joy riders" for sight seening and outdoor activities, "functional rider" for riders who want to save money and time when in a hurry like freshmen student who are in need of both.

Note! The marketting campagne should be climactic aligned with the tripduration as shown on the data visualizations on Tableau
Another trend I noticed that we have the least cutomers during the first months of the years

Here we can assume it is because of the chilly weathers that our customers don't like to ride bikes.
=Here we want to convince an audience who are like our "happy rebel" who enjoy the chill weather or those early birds who like to burn the calories from the passed holiday season and start working on their "summer body"

We can provide an additional service of "Bellabeat", a digital smartwatch that tracks trip activity to and visualises it on the customers smartphone.
